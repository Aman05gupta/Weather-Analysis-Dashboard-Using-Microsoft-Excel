# Weather-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Microsoft-Excel
This project presents an interactive Weather Analysis Dashboard created using MS Excel. It analyzes historical weather data to identify trends in temperature, rainfall, and other key weather parameters. Excel features such as pivot tables, charts, and data visualization techniques are used to provide clear insights and support data-driven analysis.

This project was developed as part of my internship at AccioJob.
